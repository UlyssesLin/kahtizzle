# Kahtizzle

Based on the popular board game Catan

Intended to be device agnostic (Mobile, and Desktop)

## Game goals

* Tick based turns with players put into 6 tick groups
  * Each tick will be based on the average turn time in normal games
* Infinate board that grows as more players join
  * Based on Vanilla Catan, with the Explorers & Pirates expansion
  * This allow us to generate more *islands* to keep the base game mechanics
* Robber mechanics will have to be slightly reworked for a large player group
  * Possibly make the robber controlled by chance/ai
    * This can also work for villagers from Explorers & Pirates
* Server side move validation
  * Road placement
  * Settlement Placement

### Work in progress

Kahtizzle is only in it's initial planning phase, with no features currently
implemented. As development moves forward breaking changes are to be expected.
